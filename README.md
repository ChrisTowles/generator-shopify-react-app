# Shopify React Starter Kit
This starter kit is designed to get you up and running quickly when building a new [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=growingecommerce) embedded app using React. While it assumes you have a backend based on [Shopify Serverless Kit](http://github.com/buggy/shopify-embedded-app) you can build your own backend using any language/framework you prefer.
